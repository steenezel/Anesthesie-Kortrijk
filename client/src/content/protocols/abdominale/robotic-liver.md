**Anesthesia for robotic liver surgery**
-----------------------------------------

While robotic liver surgery (RLS) and laparoscopic liver surgery (LLS) differ substantially from a surgical point of view, both techniques are very similar in terms of anesthesia management. In this chapter, we discuss the main points of interest for anesthesia in RLS, paying particular attention to the differences with LLS. We also address some current discussion points about anesthesia in minimally invasive liver surgery. 

 Minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) includes both LLS and RLS. MILS is gaining popularity worldwide. Despite initial concerns about the safety profile, both short-term and long-term, the benefits of MILS have become clear in recent years. LLS for colorectal liver metastases has proven to be safe, both surgically and oncologically, and is associated with reduced postoperative morbidity ​\[1,2\]​. 

Although a robotic approach to liver surgery was first described in 2003, there is almost no published literature discussing the challenges in RLS with regard to anesthesia. The main differences between RLS and LLS are a longer operating time and more risk of gas emboli, but on the other hand, less risk of conversion to open surgery and less blood loss ​\[3\]​. As in any hepatic surgery, the outcome depends on a good preparation and a shared mental model by the surgical team. 

Preoperative optimization 
--------------------------

Every patient should be evaluated preoperatively for timely recognition of increased surgical risk and to make adjustments if necessary. Preoperative counselling is useful only if it makes a difference in outcome. While most patients presenting for RLS are in good general health, it is important to screen for comorbidities that might influence the anesthetic and surgical plan of action. Standard preoperative investigations are sufficient (ECG, hemoglobin, chemistry, renal function, coagulation). Extensive cardiac and pulmonary testing is only indicated if the medical history requires it. 

 Advanced age _per se_ is no contraindication for MILS. 

***Cardiovascular disease***
------------------------

Standard cardiological risk stratification can be used to screen patients prior to MILS. 

Compared with open hepatectomy, MILS does not pose an increased perioperative risk in cardiac patients if certain precautions are taken. In patients with a higher cardiovascular risk, it is advised to gradually increase intra-abdominal pressure, starting with low-flow before switching to high-flow insufflation. When cardiac stability is reached, reversed Trendelenburg can gradually be applied. This gentle approach can help minimizing the impact of pneumoperitoneum and positioning on cardiovascular function ​\[4\]​. Performing hypovolemic phlebotomy and vascular occlusion techniques should be done with caution in high-risk patients. 

***Pulmonary disease*** 
------------------

Postoperative pulmonary complications are common in liver surgery but can be reduced by preoperative optimization of patients with pre-existing lung disease or smoking.  

Compared with open liver surgery (OLS), MILS decreases pulmonary complications in patients undergoing major liver resections. This positive effect is due to decreased pain with faster rehabilitation, the absence of transection of abdominal muscles and fewer pleural effusions ​\[5\]​.  

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are ‘well’, meaning they have normal oxygen saturation and no recent infection, have a similar perioperative risk as patients without lung disease. Preoperative stratification should therefore identify these patients that do not fulfill these conditions to be optimized preoperatively. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are more prone to postoperative pulmonary complications and will need more intensive postoperative monitoring ​\[6\]​. 

Current smokers and ex-smokers have an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Preoperative smoking cessation is beneficial. The effects of carbon monoxide and nicotine on cardiovascular function will dissipate in a few hours, but normalization of mucus production and clearance will take several weeks. A longer period of cessation will produce a more substantial reduction in postoperative complications ​\[7\]​. Smoking cessation should therefore be discussed with the patient. 

***Liver disease*** 
--------------

Most patients who present for LLS do not have generalized or advanced liver disease. Nevertheless, some patients will have pre-existing liver disease.  

There is robust evidence that patients with cirrhosis who require anesthesia and surgery have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Whether liver surgery is -more than other types of surgery- an independent risk factor predisposing cirrhotic patients to increased mortality is controversial. One retrospective review claims that cardiac surgery and intra-abdominal surgery, including liver surgery, are contra-indicated in class B cirrhotic patients ​\[8\]​. Another multivariate analysis demonstrated that liver surgery was no independent variable associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients ​\[9\]​. 

Several systems exist to assess preoperative liver function and postoperative mortality risk.  

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (CTP) ​\[10\]​ has long been the most widely used instrument to assess operative risk in cirrhotic patients. Patients are stratified in 3 groups (A, B and C) according to total bilirubin level, serum albumin level, international normalized ratio, volume of ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Surgery is tolerated well in patients with class A cirrhosis. Those in class B and C are at high risk. Mortality after non-hepatic abdominal surgery in CTP class A, B and C was found to be 10%, 17% and 63%, respectively ​\[4,11\]​. 

The MELD-score was developed in 2000 ​\[12\]​. After a few modifications it was used as the most important tool in assigning need for a liver transplant. The MELD-score can also predict outcome in non-transplant surgery ​\[13,14\]​. In contrast to the CTP-score, it is solely based on objective factors (serum creatinine, bilirubin and INR). 

Patients with liver disease who undergo surgery should be optimized preoperatively.  Managing the altered coagulation in cirrhosis is not straightforward. Patients with cirrhosis have a decrease in both pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant factors with a rebalanced hemostasis. Conventional coagulation tests cannot reliably predict coagulation status in cirrhotic patients. Visco-elastic tests such as thrombo-elastography (TEG) and rotation thrombo-elastometry (ROTEM) are more useful to guide interventions in liver surgery, including cirrhotic patients ​\[15,16\]​. Ascites could be managed by a low sodium diet, diuretics or in severe cases preoperative paracentesis with replacement by albumin. Many patients with liver disease are malnourished and should see a nutritionist preoperatively. 

***Renal disease*** 
--------------

Pre-existing chronic renal failure is a strong predictor of postoperative acute renal failure. 

Perioperative fluid restriction, used in liver surgery to lower the central venous pressure (CVP), leads to an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) ​\[17\]​.  The incidence of AKI after liver resection is 12%-15% and is associated with renal replacement therapy and mortality ​\[18\]​. Slankamenac _et al._ used a multivariate model to develop a prediction score for postoperative acute renal failure after liver resection. Four major factors were identified that could accurately predict postoperative AKI. Preoperatively elevated alanine-transaminase, preexisting cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, and diabetes were the strongest predictors of AKI. Using this information could lead to preoperative identification of patients who would benefit most of protective kidney interventions perioperatively ​\[19\]​.  

Unfortunately, few of these interventions exist. A Cochrane review looked for interventions to protect renal function in the perioperative period. Many pharmaceutical agents were investigated, such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, N-acetylcysteine, atrial natriuretic peptide, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin or hydration fluids such as colloids and hypertonic saline ​\[20\]​. 

None of the studied interventions during surgery prevented kidney damage. While none of the selected studies involved liver surgery, there is no reason to suspect that the results are not valid for MILS. 

If no pharmacological interventions can aid us in preventing acute renal failure, we should aim for other treatable and modifiable parameters such as cardiac dysfunction, preoperative kidney dysfunction, diabetes, and preoperative cholestasis. Many intraoperative parameters influencing postoperative renal function have been identified ​\[21–23\]​. 

A low CVP technique is nearly universally used in an effort to limit perioperative blood loss. Low intraoperative CVP and low arterial blood pressure are linked with postoperative acute renal failure. In a review article on normotensive ischemic acute renal failure, Abuelo points out the conditions that cause low-perfusion states and increased afferent arteriolar resistance. These risk factors for renal ischemia are often treatable and thus should be identified and dealt with, even perioperatively. If possible, blood pressure that is on the lower end of the normal range should be increased by correction of any hypovolemia ​\[24\]​. Anesthesia for MILS is about finding the optimal balance between a low CVP strategy and adequate intraoperative renal perfusion. After all, blood loss and subsequent transfusion are major risk factors for short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality.  

Renal insufficiency may be present in patients with liver disease, leading to hyponatremia. This should be slowly corrected over the course of several days to at least 130 mmol/L before surgery ​\[11\]​. Excessive use of diuretics to reduce ascites or pulmonary effusions in cirrhotic patients can also worsen renal function.  

Anesthetic Technique 
---------------------

Although an arterial catheter is not considered necessary by all experts, it seems prudent to place it in all but the most minor RLS resections. Access to the patient during RLS is restricted and the provoked relative hypovolemia quickly leads to hypotension. The arterial catheter can additionally be used to perform the phlebotomy. Moreover, there is always the possibility of a gas embolism in which case an invasive beat-to-beat measurement of blood pressure is indispensable. In contrast, a central venous catheter is certainly not always necessary. As shown further below, measurement of CVP is not useful. Administration of noradrenaline can also safely be done through a reliable peripheral infusion ​\[25\]​. 

The choice of anesthetic agents presumably does not make much difference. Both vapor and total intravenous techniques can be used. Total intravenous anesthesia was shown to offer oncological advantages over inhalational anesthesia _in vitro_. A meta-analysis comparing propofol to sevoflurane could not confirm these results in real life ​\[26\]​. Adequate muscle relaxation, measured using a continuous train-of-four monitor, is essential to achieve a calm surgical field and to minimize insufflation pressures. Measurement of body temperature with continuous attention to prevention of hypothermia is a good standard practice. 

***Prevention of blood loss*** 
-------------------------

Blood loss should be prevented as much as possible. It is clear that anemia, but certainly transfusion of allogeneic blood, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, worse oncological outcome and tumor-free survival ​\[27–29\]​. Even transfusion of one unit of packed red cells is an independent predictor for worse outcome, and this effect is dose-dependent.  Much of the research done on blood loss prevention in liver surgery has been done in OLS. Nevertheless, many lessons learned from OLS can be transferred to MILS. Luckily, RLS seems to be associated with less blood loss and transfusion than LLS.  

The most important factors rest in the hands of the surgeon: preparation of a thoughtful surgical plan, use of new dissection devices and topical fibrin sealants. Discussion of hepatic inflow occlusion techniques goes beyond the scope of a chapter about anesthesia, but these techniques can be very important in prevention of blood loss. Good communication within the team is essential as a Pringle maneuver can cause clinically relevant hypotension. In addition, hepatic ischemia is associated with lung damage that can lead to postoperative pulmonary complications ​\[30\]​.  

Two Cochrane reviews on cardiopulmonary ​\[31\]​ and pharmacological interventions ​\[32\]​ to prevent blood loss in liver surgery concluded that only aprotinin, tranexamic acid and hemodilution, with or without hypotension, lead to a reduced need for transfusion. The serine protease inhibitor aprotinin has an antifibrinolytic effect, but has been surrounded by controversy after temporary withdrawal from the market because of a poor safety profile. In contrast, the plasmin inhibitor tranexamic acid (TXA), also an antifibrinolytic, offers clearly proven added value over a wide range of clinical situations. Specifically in liver surgery, TXA reduces the risk of transfusion by up to 90% with no increased effect on thromboembolic events or mortality ​\[33\]​. In addition, TXA is an inexpensive and readily available product. There is a wide range of dosing regimens, ranging from a single bolus followed or not by repeated boluses or continuous infusion. It is not clear whether one particular regimen is preferable. The HeLiX trial ​\[34\]​ is a large, multicenter randomized trial that will provide short- and long-term answers about efficiency and safety of TXA in liver surgery, although we still have to wait several years for results.  

Many cardiovascular strategies have been developed to reduce blood loss. Traditionally, low CVP is associated with reduced blood loss, although a Cochrane review could not confirm this. Autologous blood donation and hypoventilation have no proven benefit. The effect of PEEP has been the subject of experimental and clinical studies that show it has no effect on hepatic pressures or perioperative blood loss ​\[35,36\]​. Only hemodilution has a proven added value. First used with good results in OLS  ​\[37\]​, it was proven to be useful in MILS. Several groups use a variation on classical normovolemic hemodilution by performing a hypovolemic phlebotomy ​\[38,39\]​. This involves drawing an amount of blood before parenchymal resection and not compensating it with intravenous fluids. Around 0.7% of body weight is drawn after which a restrictive fluid policy is applied. This blood is returned after the parenchymal transection phase, or earlier if necessary. Once the parenchymal transection is over, fluid resuscitation should be done to ensure hemodynamic stability. Theoretically, this technique has the potential to cause postoperative renal insufficiency, but this is rarely seen ​\[40\]​. 

***Hemodynamic management*** 
-----------------------

There is no reason to guide hemodynamic management by measuring CVP. While a relative hypovolemic state prevents blood loss, an absolute measurement of CVP is not reliable and not helpful for this purpose ​\[41,42\]​. Especially in minimally invasive surgeries with pneumoperitoneum and reverse Trendelenburg, CVP has no added value. Other dynamic parameters offer a possible alternative: use of both stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) demonstrated promising results in liver surgery ​\[43\]​. 

A low-dose continuous vasopressor is often necessary to maintain adequate end-organ tissue perfusion during the hypovolemic phase when liberal fluid administration is contra-indicated. 

Despite all preventive measures, bleeding will occasionally still occur during MILS. At the time of bleeding, patients are typically hypovolemic due to all CVP-lowering techniques. It is important to promptly compensate all blood losses with crystalloids and/or colloids. Transfusion of homologous blood should only be considered when there is a clinical need to do so. Over-transfusion in major gastrointestinal and cancer surgery is frequent: up to half of patients are overtransfused ​\[44,45\]​.  Keeping in mind the harmful effects of even a single unit of autologous blood, this should be avoided. 

Fluid resuscitation after liver resection is vital to prevent postoperative renal failure through hypoperfusion ​\[24\]​. Overcorrection of the hypovolemic state is equally dangerous: perioperative fluid overload is one of the strongest risk factors for pulmonary complications ​\[46,47\]​. Dynamic fluid responsiveness monitors could be useful to find the correct balance between adequate fluid resuscitation while at the same time preventing overload and tissue edema. Several goal-directed fluid therapy protocols are proposed, mostly based on SVV and PPV ​\[41\]​.  

***Gas embolism*** 
-------------

The combination of pneumoperitoneum, hypovolemia and reverse Trendelenburg position produces excellent working conditions for the surgeon. Even when large veins are opened, there is often minimal bleeding. While this is beneficial with regard to blood loss and prevention of transfusion, these conditions might create the potential for gas embolism. Entry of carbon dioxide through open veins leads to venous gas embolism. Accumulation of gas in the pulmonary arterioles leads to its pathophysiological effects. Large amounts of carbon dioxide can lead to a ‘gas lock’ with cardiac failure and ultimately cardiovascular collapse. Porcine models of LLS demonstrate a high incidence of carbon dioxide embolism, causing respiratory and hemodynamic disturbances ​\[48,49\]​. Reported frequencies of gas embolism in human series are low (around 1%), with most episodes not leading to postoperative complications ​\[50\]​. Still, clinically significant venous air embolism in laparoscopic surgy has a high mortality rate ​\[51,52\]​. In our own experience, RLS seems to be associated with more clinically relevant gas embolism than LLS. 

The surgical team should have a high level of suspicion for carbon dioxide embolism during MILS. The most sensitive monitoring device is transesophageal echocardiography, but given its invasiveness and safety profile we cannot recommend its use in every MILS case. Precordial Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive and very sensitive in detecting gas emboli. Standard American Society of Anesthesiologist monitoring will also detect relevant gas embolism in an early stage, if paired with a vigilant anesthesiologist. Textbook management of serious gas embolism includes deflating the pneumoperitoneum, hyperventilation, application of 100% O2 and positioning the patient in left lateral decubitus and Trendelenburg position, combined with standard resuscitative measures. Not all of these can be used in RLS: the position of the operating table is fixed during robotic surgery and deflating the abdomen will not help in solving the issue.  

We suggest creating a management algorithm to deal with serious venous gas embolism during RLS, analogous to a useful algorithm developed for robotic prostatectomy ​\[53\]​. In liver surgery temporary apnea may be useful to prevent further gas embolization through open veins, until the operation field is flooded or exposed veins are covered with moist sponges. 

Pain management 
----------------

Adequate pain management is an integral part of good anesthesia. Good pain management can also avoid chronification of postoperative pain. 

In terms of pain management, results of studies in OLS with a laparotomy cannot be simply extrapolated to MILS. The PROSPECT group looked at the ideal analgesia technique in liver surgery, but excluded MILS from their analysis because at the time their guidelines were drafted, there existed only three randomized clinical trials that examined pain management in LLS ​\[54\]​. Since then, more work has been done on analgetic techniques in LLS. So far there is no published controlled study on optimal analgesia in RLS. 

It seems logical that classical multimodal analgesia (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, weak opiates) is the basis of pain management in any protocol. Many other pharmacological interventions can also be chosen as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, such as low-dose ketamine, intravenous lidocaine, dexamethasone, clonidine and magnesium sulphate. Each of these products will act on different targets in the pain pathway to avoid postoperative pain. In addition to these, some supplementary locoregional techniques can improve postoperative pain management. 

Single shot infiltration of the trocar sites and specimen extraction wound by the surgeon is a simple, efficient technique. 

Interfascial plane blocks have gained tremendous popularity over the last decade. Although they are touted in some ERAS guidelines for laparoscopic surgery, there is a lot of skepticism within the anesthesia community about the usefulness of these blocks ​\[55\]​. The mechanism of action is unclear and the efficacy on top of a good multimodal analgesia regimen is questionable.  Initial results in LLS show moderately positive results in the first 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Generally, single shot techniques are used instead of continuous catheter techniques, with an opiate-sparing effect and better pain scores. Several approaches have been described in LLS: transversus abdominis plane blocks ​\[56\]​, whether or not combined with rectus sheath blocks ​\[57\]​, erector spinae plane blocks ​\[58,59\]​ and transmuscular quadratus lumborum blocks ​\[60\]​. The main disadvantage of all these techniques is the relatively short duration of action. Simultaneous administration of dexamethasone ​\[61\]​ or dexmedetomidine ​\[62\]​ moderately prolong the duration of action of interfascial blocks. The future will have to show whether these techniques add a clinically important value in MILS. 

Some surgical teams choose to place a thoracic epidural catheter in some LLS patients when the risk of conversion is not insignificant. Placing an epidural catheter in liver surgery used to be controversial because of the risk of postoperative coagulopathy, but this risk is so small in most hepatectomies that it is usually not an objection. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to expose patients to the risks of an epidural catheter when it offers no added value. In this regard RLS may offer an advantage: initial meta-analyses show a reduced conversion rate for RLS compared with LLS ​\[63\]​, so a prophylactic epidural catheter can be avoided. 

An elegant intermediate solution may be a single shot lumbar intrathecal injection with morphine. Not only in OLS ​\[64\]​ but also in LLS ​\[39,65\]​, spinal analgesia with intrathecal morphine produces better pain scores than intravenous opiates. Since the peak effect of intrathecal morphine occurs after about six hours, it should be placed preoperatively and, to obtain a faster effect, bupivacaine may be associated. The main concern is an increased risk of respiratory depression, although in practice this does not appear to be a problem ​\[66\]​. Recommended doses range from 100 micrograms to 500 micrograms of morphine. It is unclear what the optimal dose is that produces the best analgesic effect without causing unwanted side effects (pruritus, nausea, bradycardia, respiratory depression). A single intrathecal injection is not inferior to patient-controlled epidural analgesia in the first 48 hours postoperatively ​\[64\]​ and removes many of the disadvantages of a continuous epidural technique, such as delayed mobilization, problems with coagulopathy, dislocated catheters and need for a specialized pain team for follow-up. Compared with interfascial techniques, intrathecal morphine has the advantage of being more reliable and having a more complete analgesia profile because both the somatic and visceral components are covered. 

ERAS 
-----

Clinical pathways or fast-track pathways are multimodal ERAS protocols. These are bundles of different evidence-based interventions, each one with a small or non-measurable effect, resulting in reduced postoperative morbidity and hospital stay. Conceived in the late 1990s, they are nowadays accepted worldwide and across most surgical specialties ​\[67–69\]​. 

Ever since the first reported fast-track program for LLS ​\[70\]​, several protocols have been published ​\[71\]​. A meta-analysis of eight trials using ERAS in LLS concluded that application of these programs is safe and effective ​\[72\]​. We have also concluded that these programs are not only feasible, but can be financially advantageous ​\[73\]​. Although a literature search did not produce a specific RLS-targeted ERAS program, there is no reason why existing MILS programs would not be applicable to RLS. 

Recurring elements in ERAS protocols for MILS include reduced fasting time, preoperative clear carbohydrate drinks ​\[74\]​, intraoperative normothermia, removal of the nasogastric tube at the end of surgery, single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis, antithrombotic prophylaxis, prevention of nausea and vomiting, early mobilisation and early oral intake ​\[70,72,75,76\]​. All indwelling catheters should be removed as soon as reasonably possible.  

Success of a clinical pathway is highly dependent on a multidisciplinary approach, including not only surgeons and anesthetists, but equally preoperative intake staff, nursing staff, physical therapists, nutritionists and the hospital’s social services. It is important to inform patients of their expected preoperative and postoperative course.  

Conclusion 
-----------

Robotic liver surgery is an exciting and developing discipline, offering interesting challenges for the anesthetic team. Delivering optimal care to patients undergoing RLS requires a close communication with the rest of the surgical team. Standardization and use of evidence-based interventions is probably best achieved by assembling a dedicated anesthesia team for liver surgery. Several groups around the world have described positive results with dedicated anesthesia teams in various subdisciplines, including liver transplant surgery ​\[77,78\]​. 

Equally important is a shared mental model. This concept derives from other industries and reflects the extent to which team members acquire similar understanding of the situation leading to coordinated efficient action. A shared mental model leads to better team performance and improves making high-quality decisions ​\[79,80\]​. One example is large variation in transfusion practices, with up to half of liver surgery patients being overtransfused in some series ​\[44,45\]​ and large differences in intradepartmental transfusion practices ​\[81\]​, emphasizing the importance of standardized protocols with well-defined transfusion triggers. 

Despite a huge increase in published literature on MILS, there is still an information gap of large studies on anesthesia techniques, hemodynamic management and analgesia. Further research is definitely welcomed, both in basic physiology and in clinical applications. 

This article discusses key elements in perioperative anesthetic management for robotic liver surgery. Appropriate patient preparation, standardization of methods to avoid blood loss and transfusion, applying evidence-based interventions to prevent perioperative complications and using the newest insights in analgesic techniques and enhanced recovery may help make robotic liver surgery a new standard.
